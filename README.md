These rules help developers follow best practices, maintain consistency, and accelerate development of CDK applications.

## Purpose

Amazon Q Developer can leverage these project rules to:

- Generate more consistent and high-quality CDK code
- Follow established best practices for CDK development
- Implement secure-by-default infrastructure as code
- Accelerate development workflows
- Reduce common errors and anti-patterns
